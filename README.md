<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project covers two aspects. First, to analyze the qualities that can be associated with a good leader in Kenya. An analysis of through people’s sentiments was done to clarify what are the most popular qualities that the public would wish to see in their leaders are and what they want most from them. This is because politicians mention many different things that they would want to do for the citizens. Some mention good roads, reduction of prices of commodities, more schools to be built, healthcare systems among others.

The second aspect is to analyze which presidential candidate will win and by what margin. This part will not be for public consumption since it is very sensitive. It is intended that this part of the project will be handed to a company such as Ipsos so that they can integrate it in their analysis. Access to this information will be restricted to a few people.
