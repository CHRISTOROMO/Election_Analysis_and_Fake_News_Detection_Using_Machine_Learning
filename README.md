![My Image](banner.jpg)
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
This project is centered around the Kenyan Elections. This project will entail three parts. In the first part,  we will analyze how the messages from presidential candidates affect their image and eventually their voter popularity. We seek to analyze the different phrases used by the presidential aspirants affect the common mwananchi in a positive and negative way. This analysis can give a list of phrases that should be avoided and those that can be used to boost one‚Äôs popularity.
The second aspect of this project is to analyze the qualities that can be associated with a good leader. We are going to analyze, through people‚Äôs sentiments, what are the most popular qualities that the public would wish to see in their leaders and what they want most from them. Is it good roads, reduction of commodities, more schools to be built, among others.
The last and most sensitive part is to analyze which presidential candidate will win and by what margin. This part will not be for public consumption. We intend to hand this part of the project to a company such as Ipsos so that they can integrate it in their analysis. Access to this information will be restricted to a few people.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
